        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to inspire people to give plants to their friends,
        family, coworkers, and crushes by offering resilient plants in
        good-looking pots with customizable elements and easy delivery. We
        believe that plants make good gifts because they provide us with the
        greenery we crave in our indoor lives, they have positive effects on our
        environments and wellbeing, and they keep growing -- they’re alive!</p>

        <h3>Give People Plants</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Plants are green</b> &mdash; With people spending an average of
          over 90% of their lives indoors, it’s no wonder they crave greenery in
          their work and home spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Plants are good</b> &mdash; They convert carbon dioxide into
          oxygen, and in some cases removing harmful toxins like formaldehyde.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Plants grow</b> &mdash; Cut flowers last for only a short amount of
          time. Plants are living, growing companions for your office or home.
