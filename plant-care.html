        <h2>About Your Plant</h2>
        <p>
          <i>Sansevieria trifasciata</i> (san·​se·​veh·​ria try-fash-shee-ay-tuh) is
          a stemless, evergreen perennial native to West Africa. This resilient
          plant has thick, pointed leaves that inspire many of its nicknames (like
          mother-in-law’s-tongue). It can handle low to bright light, needs very
          little water, and filters nasty stuff like formaldehyde out of the
          air. It may take its sweet time growing, but good things take time. Plus
          it has the cool bonus feature of releasing oxygen at night &mdash;
          consider keeping your new plant friend in your bedroom.

        <h2>Light</h2>
        <p>
          Low to bright light. Low-light situations are better than tons of
          blazing sunlight.

        <h2>Water</h2>
        <p>
          When soil is very dry to touch, water the dirt directly and avoid
          getting any trapped within the leaves &mdash; that can lead to
          rot. Usually this means every 1-2+ weeks, or when the leaves look a
          little wrinkly. Distilled water prefered.

        <h2>Dirt</h2>
        <p>
          Likes being tight in its pot, so repotting is infrequent. It’s time to
          go bigger when roots poke out of dirt. Put some rocks on the bottom of
          the new pot and use aerated soil like cactus or succulent mix. Avoid
          soils with excess nitrogen, like Miracle Gro.

        <h2>Propagation</h2>
        <p>
          Splitting // Split 1 plant into 2 plants using a sharp knife at the
          roots and place in different pots. This method maintains color
          variation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhizome // This plant produces “baby” versions of itself that are
          connected to the main plant under the dirt. Split these mini versions
          off by removing the plant from the pot and taking a sharp knife to the
          “rhizome,” which looks like a fat root that curves up. Replant in
          separate pots. This method maintains color variation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaf cutting // Cut a healthy leaf at its base, then slice into 3 inch
          sections. Let sections “heal” for 2 days and place directly into
          well-aerated dirt. Instead of planting immediately, you can also place
          leaf pieces into a cup of water, and watch as roots form over the next
          month. Either way, keep cuttings in the “up” direction - they won’t root
          upside-down. You’ll lose color variation with this method.

        <h2>Flowers</h2>
        <p>
          Rarely flowers indoors, but if it does, you’ll see fragrant white
          sprays.

          Squishy, yellow leaves? Overwatered. This is the biggest problem with this plant
