      <h2>About Your Plant</h2>
      <p>
        <i>Sansevieria trifasciata</i> is a stemless, evergreen perennial that can
        last many years. This resilient plant has thick, pointed leaves that are
        quite striking. It can handle low to bright light, requires very little
        water, and filters nasty stuff out of the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        This plant is native to west Africa, and can grow to as much as 4’ tall in
        the wild. As an indoor plant it takes its time growing and generally maxes
        out at 2’.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <i>Sansevieria</i> genus has over 70 varieties, though roughly 15
        varieties are commonly found as house plants.

      <h3>Light</h3>
      <p>
        Low to bright light. This plant tolerates low-light situations better
        than intense, direct sunlight.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="care section">
      <div class="icon" style="top: 18px; left: 6px;"><img src="img/agnes icons-01.png" style="width: 64px;"></div>
      <h3>Water</h3>
      <p>
        When soil is dry to touch, water the dirt directly and avoid getting any
        trapped within the rosettes of the leaves since that can lead to
        rot. Time between watering depends on the environment, and can be from
        1-2+ weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use distilled water, or just leave a jug of tap water out for 48 hours
        so things like chlorine and fluoride dissipate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overwatering is the biggest problem with this plant!
      </p>

      <h3>Dirt</h3>
      <p>
        This plant likes being tight in its pot, so you don’t have to worry
        about repotting often. Go a level up when roots poke out of the dirt,
        and use aerated soil like cactus or succulent mix. Avoid soils with
        excess nitrogen, like Miracle Gro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rocks at the base of the pot (before you top with soil) are a good idea.
        We like lava.
      </p>

      <h3>Propagation</h3>
      <p>
        Here are 3 ways to propagate sansevieria:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Splitting &mdash; Literally split 1 plant into 2 plants using a
            sharp knife at the roots. This method maintains the color variation
            of the plant. Place in different pots.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rhizome &mdash; This plant produces “baby” versions of itself that
            spread from the main plant. You can split these mini versions off by
            removing the plant from the pot and taking a sharp knife to the
            “rhizome,” which looks like a fat root that curves up. Replant in
            separate pots. This method maintains the color variation of the
            plant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Leaf cutting &mdash; Cut a healthy leaf at its base, then cut it
            into 3 inch sections (or bigger). Let the sections “heal” for 1-2
            days, and place directly into well-aerated dirt (again,
            cactus/succulent mix + lava rocks). You can also place these into a
            cup of water, and watch as roots form over the next month or
            more. Be sure to keep the cuttings facing “up” &mdash; you put them
            in water or dirt upside down, they will not root. You’ll lose color
            variation with this method.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Flowers</h3>
      <p>
        This plant very rarely flowers indoors, but if it does, you’ll see
        fragrant white sprays.
      </p>

      <div class="icon" style="top: 24px; left: 4px;"><img src="img/agnes icons-03.png" style="width: 74px;"></div>
      <h3>Oh no!</h3>
      <p>Squishy, yellow leaves? Overwatered. </p>
      <p>Brown, wrinkled leaves? Underwatered. </p>
    </div>

      <h3>Pets</h3>
      <p>
        Mildly toxic to pets who like eating plants, particularly cats. Effects
        can include minor irritation but can potentially cause nausea or
        diarrhea depending on how much is ingested. If you are a pet owner,
        please do your research before bringing a sansevieria or any other plant
        home!
